Together with Scrimba have I made a BlackJack game. This is not the code from scrimba, but this is a version I have done fully myself after the BlackJack game course. Coded from scratch with the idea and same concept from Scrimba.

# Built With:
HTML, Bootstrap and JavaScript
- Hosted on Netlify

# Features:
- Play a Simulation of the real game blackjack
- See your current pulled cards
- Ability to see your score, and "hit" or "stand" based of the displayed score after 2 cards.
- A balance, showing how you are doing if this is of interest. (This can also be reset if balance = 0, if balance is 0 it will disable the game)
- See what the dealers result is if you decide to stand. A random number is generated for this result. Resulting in a win if you are lucky and a loss if the dealer pulls more than you but less than 21.

# Future Plans:
- UI Upgrade
- Actually SHOW the cards you are getting
- Feature for ACE, to decide if its a 1 or 11.
- Hourly balance refills
- Scoreboard
